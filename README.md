# Arithmetic-Exam-Application

**Application that generates arithmetic tasks.**

After solving the tasks, the user can save the results to the result.txt file - name and number of correct answers/number of tasks

***Additional (author) functionalities:***
- Counting the time of solving tasks (without time for generating tasks);
- Possibility to choose the number of tasks or choose "random" randomizing the number of tasks from the range 1 - 10;
